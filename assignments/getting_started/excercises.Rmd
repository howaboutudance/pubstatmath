installing the package gapminder as an example of installing a package

```{r}
# load devtools
library(devtools)
install_github("jennybc/gapminder")

# successful
```
not going to do swirl since I alreeady used it during the summer internship.

```{r}
# install rafalib that is used in some data analysis later
install.packages("rafalib")
library(rafalib)
```

Demonstrate how to load a csv file:

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/raw/master/inst/extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv"

mouse_weights = read.csv(url)

summary(mouse_weights)
```

There a few others way to do this, including loadin local files:

```{r}
mw_path <- "./femaleMiceWeights.csv"
lmouse_weights <- read.csv(mw_path)
summary(lmouse_weights)
```

```{r}
plot(x = mouse_weights$Diet, mouse_weights$Bodyweight)
```

```{r}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
car_reg_line = lm(cars$dist~cars$speed)
summary(car_reg_line)
```
